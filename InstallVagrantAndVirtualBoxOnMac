Vagrant

Vagrant is developed by Hashicorp, it is an useful tool for creating virtualised instances using Virtualbox, VMWare, AWS etc. With a simple vagrantfile, you can create uniform virtual development instances & you can also use vagrant instances to test Shell scripts, PowerShell scripts etc.  It is also very useful in testing your Configuration management cookbooks/modules.

VirtualBox

Virtualbox is a free and awesome virtualisation solution by Oracle. You can spin up multiple instance on your Mac using it, it's very useful when you want to spin up different Operating System(OS) instances on your Mac such as Ubuntu/Centos/Windows etc.

All you need is Operating System iso's. Add the iso, set desired configuration and power up the instance. You will need to install the Operating System for first use, thereafter instance will be ready for use.

Installation of VirtualBox and Vagrant

Regular Method

Download the installer to your Mac using safari browser.
Double click on the installation package & follow the instructions to install VirtualBox and Vagrant
Homebrew

It's said to be the missing package manager for MacOS, I can't agree more. I found it really useful.

To install homebrew: Paste this command in your terminal/iterm
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
Add homebrew to your .bashrc/.bash_profile : export $PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
To confirm installation is successful, Open a new terminal and type: brew doctor
Now we'll use home-brew to install VirtualBox & Vagrant.

Go to terminal and type:

brew cask install virtualbox
brew cask install vagrant
brew cask install vagrant-manager
You should be able to see these applications in Launchpad.
